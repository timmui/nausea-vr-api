This is a project for TerribleHacks 2016 in Waterloo.

The goal was to create a VR app that is specifically designed to make the user nauseous.

Using the Unity Engine, we control everyones 3D experience at the same time. The Unity Android component can be found at https://github.com/AndreiTich/NauseaVR-3D-Component


## Inspiration
One of the largest issues in VR adoption is that people feel nauseous when they don't want to. We solved this by ensuring all users of our app are nauseous.

## What it does
We crowdsource the process of making someone nauseous. The user's experience is directly controlled by anyone on our website.

## How we built it
We built our VR Android application with Unity engine. Our communication layer comprises of a websockets for live control and a Node.JS backend to hook everything together.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us can make a nice website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to pull this app off! None of us have built a VR application before and we learned all of that from scratch.
 
## What's next for NauseaVR
We aim to continue our mission of making people nauseous and we won't stop until the entire world is nauseous (unless our lawyers tell us otherwise).
